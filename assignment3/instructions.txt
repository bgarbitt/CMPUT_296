* Explore HTML and CSS
** Description

   You will make a personal profile using HTML.

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own source code.
   - You may work (pair program) with 1 other person, but both of you
     need to submit your work separately.
   - Collaboration MUST be documented using HTML comments.
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented using
     HTML or CSS comments.

** Goals

   You're going to make your own HTML page and you're going to make 2
   CSS themes for it.

   You may take this comic as inspiration but you do not have to copy it (though you may if you like):
   http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell

   But instead make a 1 webpage about each assignment partner (1 page
   if you are doing this solo and 2 webpages if you are working with someone
   else!) that advertises you to employers.

   Make 1 ugly CSS and 1 good CSS just like the design_hell comic.

   You should make a page good enough you'd actually use it as your homepage.

** Restrictions
    - [ ] License your content properly (use a Creative Commons License
        like CC-BY-ND or CC-BY-SA)
        - Put your name on it!
    - [ ] If you borrow CSS, always cite the author and the source
    - [ ] If you borrow HTML, always cite the author and the source
    - [ ] If you borrow images, make sure you have the legal right to do so,
        and cite the author and the source.
    - [ ] You may NOT use a CSS library like Bootstrap.
    - [ ] Upload a .zip file with both HTML files any other files required
        to view your page. MAKE SURE IT WORKS in your browser AFTER unzipping
        it on a DIFFERENT COMPUTER (e.g., computers in CSC 2-19) ! Be sure to not use any ABSOLUTE PATHS,
        you should only use RELATIVE paths! Do not "hot link" images,
        this generally means do not use a full URL for images.
        For example: use <img src="blah.jpg"> and put blah.jpg in the .zip 
        file.

** Recommendations

   - Go look at CSS on the internet. Check the licenses.

   - Look how things are achieved.

** Marking
    - You will receive a ZERO mark if you do not cite images, code, or CSS,
      obtained from external sources,
        along with a potential referral to the dean's office for violating
        UofA's academic code.
    - You will receive a ZERO mark if you use a CSS library (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.) instead of
        hand-written CSS you made yourself, or if you fail to license your
        content properly.
    - Violating any of the RESTRICTIONS will earn you a ZERO mark.
    - Marked by the fraction of the requirements tick boxes met.
        A requirement with sub-requirements only counts if all of its
        sub-requirements are ticked. E.g. if your pages work in Firefox and
        Chrome then you get 3 requirements.
